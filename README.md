# Customer Segmentation with K-Means

##  Project Description
This project focuses on applying the **K-Means clustering algorithm** to segment customers of a shopping mall based on their demographic and behavioral data (such as income and spending score).  

The goal is to group customers into distinct segments that share similar characteristics. These insights can then be used to design targeted marketing strategies, improve customer experience, and maximize business profitability.

##  Objectives
- Understand customer purchasing behavior through clustering.  
- Identify distinct customer groups with similar profiles.  
- Provide actionable insights for personalized marketing campaigns.  
- Demonstrate the practical use of unsupervised machine learning in business.

##  Why Customer Segmentation?
Customer segmentation allows businesses to:  
- **Personalize marketing strategies**: Different groups require different approaches.  
- **Improve customer retention**: By addressing the specific needs of each segment.  
- **Optimize resources**: Focus marketing efforts on the most profitable customer groups.  
- **Enhance product recommendations**: Suggest relevant products to the right customers.

##  Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing customer data (age, income, spending score, etc.).  
2. **Clustering with K-Means**: Applying the K-Means algorithm to segment customers.  
3. **Visualization**: Plotting clusters to interpret customer groups.  
4. **Analysis**: Extracting insights from each cluster to guide business strategy.

##  Applications of Clustering
K-Means clustering and customer segmentation can be applied in many real-world scenarios:  
- **Retail & E-commerce**: Grouping customers for personalized promotions.  
- **Banking & Finance**: Segmenting clients based on spending and credit behavior.  
- **Telecommunications**: Identifying customer groups to reduce churn.  
- **Healthcare**: Categorizing patients by symptoms or treatment response.  
- **Marketing Campaigns**: Designing campaigns tailored to specific customer clusters.

##  Technologies Used
- Python   
- Pandas (data processing)  
- Matplotlib (visualization)  

---

##  Example Output
After clustering, customers are grouped into segments such as:  
- High income, high spending  
- High income, low spending  
- Low income, high spending  
- Low income, low spending  
- Average income and spending  

Each cluster provides business insights for better decision-making.
